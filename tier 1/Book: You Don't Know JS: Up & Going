Notes: 

*Started me out with Java because it's the oldest and most widely used technology on the web. Most important for web development. Java Script, not just Java. 
*code = source code. Tells computer what tasks to perform. 
*words, numbers, symbols, operators, and arrangement of these, make up a language. 
*operator looks like this: a = b * 2; It is a mathematical operation. "a" and "b" are variables. variable = like a box you store something in, like a number. Or think of them as the number itself. 
* a digit, like the number 2, is called a literal value. 
*the "=" (assignment) and "*" (multiplication) are operators within themselves. 
*explained beautifully. The statement a=b*2; tells the computer to: 1)get current value stored in variable b 2)multiply that value by 2 3)store the result into variable a. 
*a program is a collection of statements. 
*interpreter/compiler = transforms/translates code into commands computer can understand. 
  *interpreting: translated top to bottom, line by line, every time program is run. 
  *compiling: translation done ahead of time. When program is run, it's running this already compiled computer instructions. 
*print text = output to the user. I'm using developer console until I can get Brackets to output text. 
* a=21; 
  b=a*2; 
  console.log(b); (this prints out logical conclusion.)
  42. 
     *log(b) called a 'function call'. The b variable is handed to this 'log' function. 'log' commands cpu to take variable b and print it to the console. The 'console.' part is where 'log()' is located, i.e., in the console. 
*Another way to create text/user output is with 'alert()'. And this spits out the answer in a pop-up box that I have to click 'ok'. 
*A function is a rule, that is applied to an input, and gives an output. Example: input is 5, function is you add 3, output would be 8. Function = a constant rule that is applied to an input, and spits out an output.
