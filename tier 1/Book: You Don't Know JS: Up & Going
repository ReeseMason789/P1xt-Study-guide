Notes: 

*Started me out with Java because it's the oldest and most widely used technology on the web. Most important for web development. Java Script, not just Java. 
*code = source code. Tells computer what tasks to perform. 
*words, numbers, symbols, operators, and arrangement of these, make up a language.
